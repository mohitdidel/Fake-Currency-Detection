# Fake-Currency-Detection
I am developing a **fake currency detection system** using computer vision and image processing techniques in Python. My intention is to analyze security features like bleed lines and number panels of Indian notes to automatically distinguish real from fake. My goal is to enhance reliability, accuracy, and trust in currency authentication.
